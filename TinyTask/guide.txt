Stages =  ["PlanetNamek", "SandVillage", "DoubleDungeon", "ShibuyaStation", "ShibuyaAftermath]
Act numbers = 1-8 (7 is inf, 8 is paragon, 0 is Half Hourly Challenge)
Adding Standard After The Stage Name Will Make It A DEFAULT script for that stage that will be run if there isn't a unique script available

FOR CUSTOM TINY TASK MACROS:

save the macro as [STAGENAME + ACT NUMBER].exe
And PUT INTO \TinyTask\ (should be here)
e.g. 
PlanetNamek7.exe - runs for infinite mode for Planet Namek
PlanetNamek0.exe - runs in Planet Namek half hourly challenges
PlanetNamekStandard.exe - will run on any Planet Namek level for which a ttask script does not exist

SandVillage4.exe - runs on act 4 of sand village

DoubleDungeon3.exe - runs on Double Dungeon act 3 (if legend stage is selected this is Igris)

Raid4.exe - runs on raid act 4 (Rengoku)
RaidStandard.exe - will run on any raid level for which a ttask script does not exist

Spirit4.exe - runs on spirit act 4
SpiritStandard.exe - etc

ShibuyaStation1.exe - runs on Shibuya station act 1
ShibuyaAftermath1.exe - the 1st legend stage of Shibuya station (Because Shibuya legend stages have a different name, they will be named accordingly)
