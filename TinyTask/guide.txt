Stages =  ["Planet Namek", "Sand Village", "Double Dungeon"]
Act numbers = 1-8 (7 is inf, 8 is paragon, 0 is Half Hourly Challenge)
Adding Standard After The Stage Name Will Make It A DEFAULT script for that stage that will be run if there isn't a unique script for that act

FOR CUSTOM TINY TASK MACROS:

save the macro as [STAGENAME + ACT NUMBER].exe
And PUT INTO \TinyTask\ (should be here)
e.g. 
PlanetNamek7.exe - runs for infinite mode for Planet Namek
PlanetNamek0.exe - runs in Planet Namek half hourly challenges

SandVillage4.exe - runs on act 4 of sand village

DoubleDungeon3.exe - runs on Double Dungeon act 3 (if legend stage is selected this is Igris)

Raid4.exe - runs on raid act 4 (Rengoku)

RaidStandard.exe - will run on any raid level for which a ttask script does not exist

PlanetNamekStandard.exe - will run on any Planet Namek level for which a ttask script does not exist
